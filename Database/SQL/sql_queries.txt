Slide ID (there will be multiple images on the database corresponding to the same slide)
       - Lab/Owner of the image
       - Upload date
       - Positive/negative for infection (more for the purpose of the recognition software)   
       - Species (allow user to search for human or mouse samples, for example)
       - Strain (eg. falciparum, vivax)
       - Latest identified stage (eg. gametocyte)
       - Parasitic count (it would be useful to get an idea of range for this)
       - Image zoom (microscope zoom)
       - Volume of sample (estimated volume of blood on the slide, unless this is something that we could calculate using the recognition software itself, based on, for example, number of WBCs)
       - Type of staining used (eg. Giemsa or other)
       - Other comments (would it be useful to allow an uploader to attach additional comments to clarify any unusual features?)

FOR INSERTING:

INSERT INTO Malaria (Unique ID, Status, Species, etc, etc)
VALUES (101, ‘Positive’, ‘Human’, ‘etc’, ‘etc’);


FOR EDIT:

UPDATE malaria
SET Status=‘Positive’
WHERE UniqueID=101;


FOR DELETE:

DELETE FROM Malaria
