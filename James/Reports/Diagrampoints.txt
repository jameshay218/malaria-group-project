"Diagnosis using stained blood films is time consuming and requires input from a highly-trained expert"

"Malaria predominant in less developed, subtropical regions - often in rural areas with a lack of equipment and a particular lack of adequately trained technicians"

"Rapid diagnostic tests have a higher detection threshold than blood film microscopy, and are therefore less sensitive"

"Other malaria detection methods may be slow and innaccurate (subjective diagnosis), expensive (molecular methods), or require specialised settings (PCR)"

"Reagent storage requirements make rapid diagnostic tests impractical in the field"

Benefits
*****************************************************************************************
"Earlier diagnosis allows for more successful treatment and helps reduce the spread of disease"

"Could be used in a rural setting, only requiring a computer and microscope"

"Reduces the need for a specialist trained in malaria diagnosis where such an opinion is unattainable"

"Could reduce the workload of a trained microscopist in the majority of cases through providing a fast and reliable classification"

"Software could collect data to store in a central database"

"Can be used in conjunction with other diagnostic techniques (eg. antigen testing) to clarify uncertain cases"
